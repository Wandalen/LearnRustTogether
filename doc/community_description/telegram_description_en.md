Hello, we are a Ukrainian branch of 🦀 the Rust Community.

🏁 We strive to provide all members with the space to build trusting professional relationships in an informal way by supporting and developing each other.

🤝 One is not a warrior in the field. Our goals are to popularize Rust in Ukraine, develop the community around it, launch and support all-Ukrainian mentoring and educational programs, and attract Rust projects and related investments in Ukraine,as well as the spread of our values:

- 💜 **mutual assistance**
- 🐣 **openness to** listen to alternative points of view
- 📃 cultivation of **Open Source** culture
- 🤗 fostering a **friendly attitude** towards each other

The Rust communities have always been distinguished by those values and that’s why we love ❤️ Rust.
